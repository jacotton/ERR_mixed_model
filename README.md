# mixed-effects model to estimate individual level egg-reduction rates

Code to implement the mixed-effects model for egg reduction rates. 

Model is from Martin Walker (Martin Walker (mwalker@rvc.ac.uk).

Code by Tom Crellen (thomas.crellen@bdi.ox.ac.uk), and Martin, plus a tiny bit by James Cotton (jc17@sanger.ac.uk).

This code was originally used in:


The script called Crellen_CID.trimmed_script.R should recreate this analysis exactly


The individual ERR results were recalculated (identically up to Markov error)  then also used, and marginal distributions calculated for some different subsets of individuals in:


The script ERR.R will recreate exactly this analysis.
